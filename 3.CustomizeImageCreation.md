# Download the image creation tutorial from eflows4HPC and customize it

In this section of the tutorial, we are going to download all the necessary packages to create the Docker image with our customized repositories.

## Install docker

First of all, we need to install Docker on our operating system.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

If you are using Linux, also take a look at the post-installation steps.

## Running the Image Creation Software on Your Own Computer and Customizing It

Once the Docker installation is complete, run the image creation container. This container already contains all the configuration files needed to create an example image. 
We will start from these initial files to create our customized image.

```
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it ghcr.io/eflows4hpc/image_creation:compss_tutorial /bin/bash
```
If everything has gone well, you should see the following:
```
root@29f99468a739:/# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  image_creation  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  software-catalog  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```
In this directory, rename the `software-catalog` folder to `software-catalog-old`, then clone your customized software catalog into this directory and rename it to `software-catalog`.
```
mv software-catalog/ software-catalog-old
git clone https://github.com/EvaHdez97/software-catalog-test.git
mv software-catalog-test/ software-catalog
```
The next step is to edit the configuration file to set up the customized workflow registry and the Docker Hub repository for the image.
```
vi image_creation/config/configuration.py 
```
Friendly reminder: to edit with the vim editor, press the `I` key.

Inside the file, change the "images_prefix" option. This option corresponds to the username of your Docker Hub account where you will store the images.
```
registry_cfg = {
    "url" : None,
    "user": None,
    "token": None,
    "images_prefix": "eflows4hpc/"
    }
```
```
registry_cfg = {
    "url" : None,
    "user": None,
    "token": None,
    "images_prefix": "evahdez/"
    }
```
The second change to make inside this file is to replace the link to the GitHub repository of the workflow registry with our customized one.
```
repositories_cfg = {
    "workflow_repository":"https://github.com/eflows4hpc/workflow-registry.git",
    "software_repository":"/software-catalog/"
    }
```
```
repositories_cfg = {
    "workflow_repository":"https://github.com/EvaHdez97/workflow-registry-test.git",
    "software_repository":"/software-catalog/"
    }
```
It is not necessary to change the "software_repository" option because we already changed the folder name when we cloned it earlier.

Now you can save the file by pressing the "ESC" key, then typing ":wq", and finally pressing Enter.

Now, we are going to create the request.json file to describe the operating system we are using, the architecture, the container engine, and the workflow description.
```
cd image_creation
cp test_request.json request.json
vi request.json
```
Following the example provided in this tutorial, the request.json file should look like this:
```
{
    "machine": {
         "platform": "linux/amd64", "architecture": "zen2", "container_engine": "docker" 
         },
    "workflow":"DTC-V2-TEST", 
    "step_id" :"METEO-GFS-TEST", 
    "force": "true",
    "push": "false"
}
```
Once all of this is configured, we can start the creation of the image with the following command:
```
python3 /image_creation/cic_builder.py --request=request.json
```
