# Download the image creation tutorial from eflows4HPC and customize it

In this section of the tutorial, we are going to download all the necessary packages to create the Docker image with our customized repositories.

## Install docker

First of all, we need to install Docker on our operating system.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

If you are using Linux, also take a look at the post-installation steps.

## Running the Image Creation Software on Your Own Computer and Customizing It

Once the Docker installation is complete, run the image creation container. This container already contains all the configuration files needed to create an example image. 
We will start from these initial files to create our customized image.

```
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it ghcr.io/eflows4hpc/image_creation:compss_tutorial /bin/bash
```
If everything has gone well, you should see the following:
```
root@29f99468a739:/# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  image_creation  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  software-catalog  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```
