## Workflow Components

workflow-registry
  |- workflow_1
  |    |- step_1
  |    |    |- eflows4hpc.yaml               
  |    |    |- src                     
  |    |       ...
  |    |- step_2
  |         ....
  |- workflow_2                                
  |	...

- Workflow_1 subfolder: Name of the DTC (Digital Twin Component) and the initial type of the DTC (V-Volcano, T-Tsunami, E-Earthquake,...)
- Step_1 subfolder: Name of the software of the DTC (METEO-GFS)
- eflows4hpc.yaml file: Sofware requirements for this workflow step as a Spack environment specification (Contains the same information as the Spack.yaml file.)
- src folder: Folder to save all necessary files for running the software.

## Software Catalog Components

software-catalog
  |- packages
  |    |- software_1  Spack package name    
  |    |    |- package.py		Installation description following the Spack package format
  |    |       ...
  |    |- software_2    
  |          ....
  |- cfg				Spack configuration used by the Image Creation Service
  |    |-packages.yaml  Basic packages to generate the image
  |    |-repos.yaml     Name of the folder containing the files used by the image creation software to install the software packages (software-catalog)
  |    
  |- repo.yaml				Namespace description of this repository  (software-catalog-test)

- packages folder: Contains all the spack packages folders
- software_x : Subfolders to each Spack package
- package.py : Installation file for the Spack package.
- cfg folder : Spack configuration used by the Image Creation Service
- packages.yaml : Basic packages to generate the image
- repos.yaml : Name of the folder containing the files used by the image creation software to install the software packages (/software-catalog)
- repo.yaml : Namespace description of the software catalog repository  (software-catalog-test)
