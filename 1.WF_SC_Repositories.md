## Workflow Components

Example Workflow Registry Repository: https://github.com/EvaHdez97/workflow-registry-test.git

```
workflow-registry
  |- workflow_1
  |    |- step_1
  |    |    |- eflows4hpc.yaml               
  |    |    |- src                     
  |    |       ...
  |    |- step_2
  |         ....
  |- workflow_2                                
  |	...
```
- Workflow_1 subfolder: Name of the DTC (Digital Twin Component) and the initial type of the DTC (V-Volcano, T-Tsunami, E-Earthquake,...)
- Step_1 subfolder: Name of the software of the DTC (METEO-GFS)
- eflows4hpc.yaml file: Software requirements for this workflow step as a Spack environment specification (Contains the same information as the Spack.yaml file.) In the eflows4HPC YAML file, you can include the "apt" command to install specific programs that are not included, or the "pip" command to install Python packages.
- src folder: Folder to save all necessary files for running the software.

## Software Catalog Components

Example Software Catalog Repository: https://github.com/EvaHdez97/software-catalog-test.git

```
software-catalog
  |- packages
  |    |- software_1     
  |    |    |- package.py		
  |    |       ...
  |    |- software_2    
  |          ....
  |- cfg				
  |    |-packages.yaml  
  |    |-repos.yaml     
  |    
  |- repo.yaml				
```
- packages folder: Contains all the spack packages folders
- software_x : Subfolders to each Spack package
- package.py : Installation file for the Spack package.
- cfg folder : Spack configuration used by the Image Creation Service
- packages.yaml : Basic packages to generate the image
- repos.yaml : Name of the folder containing the files used by the image creation software to install the software packages (/software-catalog)
- repo.yaml : Namespace description of the software catalog repository  (software-catalog-test)
