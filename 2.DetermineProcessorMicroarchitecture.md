# How to determine your processor microarchitecture

We will use the processor microarchitecture to configure the image creation software. 

If you already know the microarchitecture of your processor, you can skip this step.

To determine the microarchitecture of our CPU processor, we utilized a Python package called "archspec". Archspec aims to provide a standardized set of human-understandable labels for various aspects of system architecture, such as CPU, network fabrics, etc., along with APIs to detect, query, and compare them.

IMPORTANT: It is necessary to install Python3 before installing archspec.

## Steps to install Archspec

The archspec Python package needs poetry to be installed from VCS sources. The preferred method to install it is via its custom installer outside of any virtual environment:
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
You can refer to Poetry's documentation for further details or for other methods to install this tool. You'll also need tox to run unit test:
```
pip install --user tox
```
Finally, you'll need to clone the repository:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/archspec/archspec.git
cd archspec
```
Running unit tests

Once you have your environment ready you can run archspec unit tests using tox from the root of the repository:
```
$ tox
  [ ... ]
  py27: commands succeeded
  py35: commands succeeded
  py36: commands succeeded
  py37: commands succeeded
  py38: commands succeeded
  pylint: commands succeeded
  flake8: commands succeeded
  black: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)
```
## How to use Archspec

### Host detection

Detection of the host where archspec is being run can be performed with a simple function call:
```
cd archspec
python3
>>> import archspec.cpu
>>> host = archspec.cpu.host()
```
where the return value is a :py:class:`archspec.cpu.Microarchitecture` object. To obtain the label of the host one can simply convert this object to a string:
```
>>> str(host)
'zen3'
```
If more information is needed the object can also be converted to a built-in dictionary:
```
>>> import pprint
>>> pprint.pprint(host.to_dict())
{'features': ['abm',
              'aes',
              'avx',
              'avx2',
              'bmi1',
              'bmi2',
              'clflushopt',
              'clwb',
              'clzero',
              'cx16',
              'f16c',
              'fma',
              'fsgsbase',
              'mmx',
              'movbe',
              'pclmulqdq',
              'pku',
              'popcnt',
              'rdseed',
              'sse',
              'sse2',
              'sse4_1',
              'sse4_2',
              'sse4a',
              'ssse3',
              'vaes',
              'vpclmulqdq',
              'xsavec',
              'xsaveopt'],
 'generation': 0,
 'name': 'zen3',
 'parents': ['zen2'],
 'vendor': 'AuthenticAMD'}
```
Once you obtain all this information, the label you must use to configure the image creation software is `name`
```
'name': 'zen3',
```
