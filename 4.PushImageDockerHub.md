# How to modify the created image and push it to a Docker Hub repository

Once the image is created, you may want to add files or create directories to prepare for production.
This section may assist you.

## List docker images
```
docker images 
```
## Run an existing image
```
docker run -dt existing_image 
```
## See if container is running
```
docker ps
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND   CREATED              STATUS              
# c7e6409a22bf   existing-image   "R"       6 minutes ago        Up 6 minutes
```
## If your container doesn't start use this command to check out the status
```
docker ps -a
```
## Shell into it
```
docker exec -it c7e6409a22bf bash
```
## Make a new directory for demonstration purposes
```
# (note that this is inside the existing image)
mkdir NEWDIRECTORY
```
## Open another terminal tab/window, and save the running container you modified
```
docker commit c7e6409a22bf my-new-image
```
## Inspect to ensure it saved correctly
```
docker image ls
# REPOSITORY           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
# existing-image       latest    a7dde5d84fe5   7 minutes ago   888MB
# my-new-image         latest    d57fd15d5a95   2 minutes ago   888MB
```
## Stop docker container
```
docker stop c7e6409a22bf
```
